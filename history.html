						<p>In 1871 in Peshtigo, Wisconsin, the greatest fire disaster in American history occurred, claiming more than 1,100 lives and burning more than 2,400 square miles. Incidentally, the fire occurred the same day as the Great Chicago Fire, which ravaged the cities core further down the coast of Lake Michigan from Pestigo. These events were instrumental in conservationists' push for fire suppression, as these forest fires were a threat to watersheds and the valuable timber that they consume. <br/><br/>In the early 1900's, policy was enacted to prevent fires as much as possible and to entinguish one as soon as it began. Fire prevention was an important part of public education, which is where Smokey Bear came into existence.</p><br/>
						<p>Historically, fire was a regular part of maintaining a healthy ecosystem, and in the 1970's scientists were finding increasing evidence of this. This resulted in more policy change that turned the tides back the other direction, allowing fires to continue to burn in wilderness areas in particular with intervention only where necessary. This wasn't without consequence, however. Several devastating fires occurred in subsequent years, primarily due to the massive amounts of dry fuel that resulted from nearly a century of fire suppression.</p><br/>
                        <p>What does this history mean for wildfires in the modern day? Continue to the <a href="concern.html">next</a> page to find out why this is all part of the "perfect storm" that has resulted in more severe fires in recent years.</p><br/>
