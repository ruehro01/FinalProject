						<p>The number of wildfires and their severity has increased notably over the past century according to historical wildfire data from the USGS. In recent years, scientists have put together increasing evidence that climate change has been a major contributing factor, as the areas that have grown hotter and drier in the United States have been those hit hardest by wildfires. This describes the Western United States in particular, where the predominant tree that covers the landscape are various species of pine. Pine beetles have killed massive swaths of these over the years, adding to the accumulation of standing dead timber.</p><br/>
						<p>While USGS data suggests that the annual numbers of fires has not changed much in the past century of data records, the severity and intensity of these fires has. It is a result of the combination of a hotter and drier climate, as well as the nearly century and a half of dead timber accumulated on the landscape as a result of fire suppression in the United States. While fire is still an important aspect of the life cycle of an ecosystem, the average wildfire has become much too hot and aggressive in comparison to what these plants actually need to open their cones and fruits to release their seeds.</p><br/>
                        <p>Data suggests these wildfire trends will continue in the United States for the foreseeable future until there are enough areas that have been deprived of their fuel that wildfire burns itself out from the landscape much more quickly that we are currently seeing. This "perfect storm" of a changing climate and over a century of fuel on the landscape cannot be stopped at this point, only managed.</p><br/>
